# START HERE: Your First 10 Minutes

Welcome to the **Research OS Foundation**. This repository is your "operating system" for running agentic projects.

## 1. Setup (The "Start Button")
1.  **Clone or Template**: Use this repo as a template for your new project.
2.  **Rename**: Change the folder name to your project's codename (e.g., `project-alpha`).
3.  **Init**: Run `git init` to start fresh tracking.

## 2. The Golden Rule
> **"If it's not in a file, it didn't happen."**

Codex (and your team) cannot read your mind or your temporary chat logs. Every insight, decision, or output must be saved to a file in the correct `S[XX]` directory.

## 3. How to Run a Project
Follow the **Standard Operating Loop**:
1.  **Define Context**: Put your PRD, notes, and constraints into `/S00-foundation/context.md`.
2.  **Select a Workflow**: Go to `/S20-workflows/` and pick the recipe that matches your goal.
3.  **Execute with Codex**: Tell Codex: *"Read S00-foundation/context.md and run the [Workflow Name]."*
4.  **Review & Bank**: Check the outputs in `/S30-examples/` (or your working folder), then "bank" the good ones by committing them.

## 4. Key Files to Know
*   `AGENTS.md`: The rulebook for AI agents.
*   `S10-primitives/SAVE-RULES.md`: How to name and save files so you don't lose them.
*   `S20-workflows/workflow-context-to-output.md`: The default way to get work done.

## 5. Next Step
Go to `/S00-foundation/PROJECT-LIFECYCLE.md` to see how to move your project from "Idea" to "Production."
